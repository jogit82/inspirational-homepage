# Inspirational Homepage using React Redux Toolkit

There is this browser extension that I love, it is called Momentum. I thought, what if I want to build something like this? What is involved in order for this to run as a web app instead of an extension?

Here is what the extension looks like, and the next image is what my web app looks like:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Momentum:
